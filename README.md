The Cervical cancer (Risk factors) dataset (Available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29#) comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients. This data set was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. Several patients decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy concerns (missing values).

The data set contains 32 risk factors and 4 target variables:

- (int) Age
- (int) Number of sexual partners
- (int) First sexual intercourse (age)
- (int) Num of pregnancies
- (Nominal) Smokes: whether the patient smokes?
- (Float) Smokes (years)
- (Float) Smokes (packs/year)
- (Nominal) Hormonal Contraceptives
- (Float) Hormonal Contraceptives (years)
- (Nominal) IUD: whether the patient use Intrauterine Device
- (int) IUD (years)
- (Nominal) STDs: whether the patient has sexually transmitted diseases
- (int) STDs (number)
- (Nominal) STDs:condylomatosis
- (Nominal) STDs:cervical condylomatosis
- (Nominal) STDs:vaginal condylomatosis
- (Nominal) STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis
- (Nominal) STDs:syphilis
- (Nominal) STDs:pelvic inflammatory disease
- (Nominal) STDs:genital herpes
- (Nominal) STDs:molluscum contagiosum
- (Nominal) STDs:AIDS
- (Nominal) STDs:HIV
- (Nominal) STDs:Hepatitis B
- (Nominal) STDs:HPV
- (int) STDs: Number of diagnosis
- (int) STDs: Time since first diagnosis
- (int) STDs: Time since last diagnosis
- (Nominal) Dx:Cancer: whether the patient had been diagnosed with cancer in the past?
- (Nominal) Dx:CIN: whether the patient had been diagnosed with Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
- (Nominal) Dx:HPV: whether the patient had HPV
- (Nominal) Dx:
- (Nominal) Hinselmann: target variable
- (Nominal) Schiller: target variable
- (Nominal) Cytology: target variable
- (Nominal) Biopsy: target variable

Cervical cancer is diagnosed in these patient using 4 methods, corresponding to 4 target variables. Hinselmann is a test method for cervical cancer by examining the cells on an instrument called colposcope. Biopsy is a surgical extraction to collect sample cells or tissues for further examination to identify the presence or extent of a disease. Schiller is a test which use applied iodine to the cervix. Then the iodine shows brown color, indicates of healthy cells, otherwise appearing white or yellow color, remains unstained, indicates abnormal cells. Cytology is a cervical cell taken from Pap-smear examination under a microscope.
